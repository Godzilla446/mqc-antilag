# yorick-antilag

This script enables antilag and "twostep" functionality in your FiveM server.

# Configuration

In addition to enabling antilag, you can also configure the following options:

- explosionSpeed: The speed at which the explosion is created. Default is 25. <br>
- Cars: The number of cars that will be created for the effect. Default is 4. <br>
- flameSize: The size of the flames. Default is 6. <br>
- To configure these options, edit the config.lua file. <br>

# Usage

To use antilag in your FiveM server, simply start the yorick-antilag resource, `ensure yorick-antilag`. By default, the antilag effect is triggered when the vehicle's RPM is above 85 RPM. If you would like to change this, you can edit the config.lua file in the yorick-antilag folder.
